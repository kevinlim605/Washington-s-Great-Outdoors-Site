      'At the easterly edge of the Pasayten Wilderness, almost touching the Canadian border, lies Horseshoe Basin. A truly unique and beautifully remote place, Horseshoe Basin is one of the few places in the Lower 48 to contain arctic tundra and is home to bears, deer and bighorn sheep, if you know where to look. A backpacking favorite where you can spend a day—or a week—exploring the wonders of this alpine landscape. Climb the local peaks, check out the Canadian border monuments, or kick back and watch the marmots.',

      'The Central Cascades region is a very popular recreational area situated less than two hours drive from Seattle. It is possible to leave metropolis with its unbearable speed of life and in several hours be in the wilderness where time stops. Hike an iconic section of the PCT north of Snoqualmie Pass. This narrow and rocky trail also includes old-growth forest, gorgeous wildflowers, and stunning views into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness from both sides of the pass below Kendall Peak, where the Katwalk begins.',

      'Mount Angeles is the highest point between Hurricane Ridge and the Strait of Juan De Fuca in Olympic National Park. It offers incredible views from Canada to Mount Olympus. It is only about 15 miles from the town of Port Angeles and is a very popular climb, both in winter and summer. Summer offers a hike and a scramble to the top while winter offers a nice fairly easy snow climb with a short easy chute at the end to the summit.',

      "This is a trail to save until August or September. This popular hike provides a range of alpine experiences in a short loop. Walk along a hillside above a small valley, pause at a viewpoint overlooking a lake, and stroll through grassy meadows with stunning views of Mount Rainier. In season enjoy an abundance of wildflowers or perhaps a handful of huckleberries. Because it's a short, flat, loop, this is our pick for taking out-of-towners who may not hike much.",

      "Burroughs Mountain has been described as a mountain against a mountain. At over 7800 feet, Burroughs Mountain sets right up against the northeastern face of Mount Rainier, hugging the Winthrop Glacier. Potentially one of the most iconic Mount Rainier hikes, the Burroughs trail will get you up close and personal with the mountain -- so close you feel like you can touch the summit. It's near impossible to choose just one or two essential Mount Rainier hikes, but this hike is so well-rounded, it makes the cut.",
