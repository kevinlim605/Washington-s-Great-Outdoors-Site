        description: "At the easterly edge of the Pasayten Wilderness, almost touching the Canadian border, lies Horseshoe Basin. A truly unique and beautifully remote place, Horseshoe Basin is one of the few places in the Lower 48 to contain arctic tundra and is home to bears, deer and bighorn sheep, if you know where to look. A backpacking favorite where you can spend a day—or a week—exploring the wonders of this alpine landscape. Climb the local peaks, check out the Canadian border monuments, or kick back and watch the marmots. At night, listen for the coyotes and count stars.",
