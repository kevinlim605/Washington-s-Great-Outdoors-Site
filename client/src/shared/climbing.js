      'This amazing, alpine granite paradise is situated right on the Cascade Crest with a starting elevation of 4,875! When approached from the east by Winthrop, the massive, immaculate granite formations stand like sentinels guarding the area. Unlike other alpine rock in the Cascades, these granite escarpments have long, continuous crack systems. These systems mean the rock is less crumbly and more consistently sustained, making for a much more pleasant and straight-forward climbing experience.',

    description:
      'Index is legendary in climbing circles. Off the map to outsiders for most of its history, due to its notoriety as an aid climbing venue, the ‘80s saw many old aid lines go free. Later, the ‘90s gave birth to a smattering of bolted sport routes. As progress continued, it was inevitable that Index would not stay a locals only spot for long. The style here is very trad—even the sport lines, short of the slab and knobby face routes have the feel.',

      'Rising to 10,781 feet with a nearly 9,000 feet prominence from sea level, Mount Baker demands to be climbed. When viewed from nearby Bellingham, her relief is dramatic! For those wishing to climb Baker, it would be wise to know that after Mount Rainier to the south, Baker is the most glaciated mountain in the lower 48. Indigenous peoples called the mountain Kulshan before white settlers renamed the geological wonder.',

      'Mount Rainier needs little introduction. Rising from the continental shelf of the Pacific to an impressive 14,411ft, this volcano (yes, an active volcano) dominates everyone’s skyline from Everette to Olympia. It is so big, Mount Rainier creates its own weather, which should be top of mind for climbers once standing at its base. Weather determines how long you can be up there until the mountain’s mood changes.',

      'Within 10 miles of town, you’ll find 50 crags featuring climbs of varied difficulty on clean, solid granite. Outer Space, Orbit, and Iconoclast on Snow Creek Wall are multi-pitch routes that climbers from around the country come to tick off. Meanwhile, the walls of Castle Rock, Midnight Rock, Careno Crag, and Givler’s Dome house many more of the state’s best climbs. These spots boast sandstone slabs that give climbers multi-pitch challenges and jaw-dropping views of the Cascade range.',
