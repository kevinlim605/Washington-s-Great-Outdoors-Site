      "This ride initially takes you up the secluded but strenuous Ape Canyon Trail before continuing to the upper trail segments. As you ride along the canyon near the top of the climb, the terrain transforms from shady forest to an amazing moonscape. The balance of the ride is across the vast pumice fields on the Loowit and Plains of Abraham trails at the base of Mt. St. Helens. You'll occasionally get openings with gorgeous views across the plains, a devastation spurred by its eruption in the 80's.",

      'The signature north-side Galbraith ride and an instant favorite, this trail starts with the standard north-side climb before taking riders on the entirety of Golden Spike and much of SST. Golden Spike unleashes a succession of jumps with small rooty sections and flowy turns. In addition to these trail delights, there is a gravel road crossing early on. Towards the end, riders are presented with a steep rock-roll down and and a follow through to a wicked fun descent that emerges onto Birch Falls Way.',

      'This trail is a favorite on the bike. The first 1.7 miles climbs a mellow 400 ft as it follows Cutthroat Creek to Cutthroat Lake. (Take a peek at Cutthroat Lake by taking the 0.2 mile spur trail.) From the lake, the trail climbs another 1900 ft in 3.8 miles to Cutthroat Pass (6800 ft). Prepare for gorgeous mountain views! The trail is really nice for biking: the grade is never too steep and the singletrack is basically smooth and firm, with variable sections of sandy, or loose rocky Eastern Washington tread.',

    description:
      "Angel's Staircase is a physically demanding, epic loop that takes you far from civilization, so bring plenty of food and water and make sure that you carry tools that you know how to use. The rewards are fantastic views of jagged mountains and into beautiful alpine basins filled with flowers, trees, and small lakes. Epic has been heavily overused, but when it comes to mountain biking the Methow Valley, this word is used more often than not to describe the Angels Staircase Loop.",
